# Dictionary-Game 

## Dictionary Tool using FourtyTwoWords words api.

### In this repository you'll find my code for a Dictionary Game, written in Ruby.
### You can try running the "Dictionary game.arb" file and the rest of the process with be self explanatory.

###  Some features of the game:
* 1. Word Game : It will start a guessing game where the user is given hints about the word, and he has to guess them. 
    - [x] Option 1: Try again: A chance to guess the word again
    - [x] Option 2: Get a Hint: A chance to get a hint to answer, but it costs you some points :(
    - [x] Option 3: Skip: Don't like the current word? No worries, you can always skip to the next word
    - [x] Option 4: Exit the Game in case you've played too much
    

* 2. **Word of the day** : Picks up a random word provided by the FourtyTwoWords API and prints all the details of theat word.

* 3. **Get Antonyms & Synonyms** : Picks up a random word provided by the FourtyTwoWords API and prints all the available antonyms & synonyms for that word.

* 4. **Word Definitions** : Picks up a random word provided by the FourtyTwoWords API and prints all its definitions available.

* 5. **Word Word Examples** : Picks up a random word provided by the FourtyTwoWords API and prints all its.... you know by now.


### The collection of words is limited now, I hope there will be more features in the future.
### Meanwhile I'll keep this repo updated, if something new comes up. Stay tuned.

## Have a good day!
